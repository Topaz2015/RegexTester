# RegexTester
A Regular Expressions tester written in java



Created for the purpose of verifying regular expressions on the desktop while working on projects. It is still a work in progress.



Hope to add capability to auto-generate possible string given an expression, and later, the capability to auto-generate a regular expression given a string of characters.
